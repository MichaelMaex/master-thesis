On rings like $\Z$ and $\Q$ and $\C$ the absolute value function gives a way of measuring how \emph{large} each element is. 
We can axiomatize properties of an absolute value function and look for them on arbitrary rings. 
These types of functions are called (semi)norms, absolute values or valuations, depending on the specific proprieties and context.  
In \cref{chap:intro_berkovich} we will use norms as the points that make up Berkovich spaces, which are one of the main objects studied in this thesis. 
So in this chapter we will make sure that we have a solid understanding of norms, as well as to fix some definitions and conventions.
