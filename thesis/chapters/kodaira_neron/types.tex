The classification puts the elliptic curve $E$ into one of the following types 
\[
	\mathrm{I}_0,\quad \mathrm{I}_1,\quad \mathrm{I}_n,\quad \mathrm{II},\quad \mathrm{III},\quad \mathrm{IV},\quad \mathrm{I}_0^*,\quad \mathrm{I}_{n}^*,\quad \mathrm{II}^*,\quad \mathrm{III}^*, \quad \mathrm{IV}^*
,\]
with $n \in \Z_{\ge 2}$ for type $\mathrm I_n$ and $n \in \Z_{\ge 1}$ for type $\mathrm I_n^*$. 
These are visualized in \cref{fig:reduction_types_of_e}.

The elliptic curves with semistable reduction are precisely those of type $\mathrm I_n$ with $n \ge 0$. 
Note that while elliptic curves of type  $\mathrm{II}$, $\mathrm{III}$, $\mathrm{IV}$ have minimal regular models with reduced special fibers, they are not semistable as their special fibers have singular points that are not ordinary double points. 
So curves of type  $\mathrm{II}$, $\mathrm{III}$, $\mathrm{IV}$ are not semistable. 

The reduction type of a curve reveals a lot of arithmetic properties of the curve. 
A good overview of these properties can be found in \cite[tab.\ 4.1, p.\ 365]{silvermanAdvancedTopicsArithmetic1994}.
For the applications that we consider in this thesis we are only interested in the combinatorial properties of the special fiber, in particular how it desingularizes to a minimal snc-model. 
Later in \cref{tab:skeleton_by_kodaira_neron} we also show how the special fiber of the minimal snc-model looks like for each type.
