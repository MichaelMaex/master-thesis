In the previous chapter we have seen that for curves of genus $g(C) > 0$ there is a unique minimal regular model, $\mathscr C_\text{reg} $.
We can describe this model just by its combinatorial properties, i.e.\ irreducible components in $\mathscr C_s$, their multiplicities, their genera and their intersections.
This gives a way of classifying arithmetic curves by their minimal regular models. 
For genus $1$ curves, i.e.\ elliptic curves this was first done by K.\ Kodaira \cite{kodairaCompactAnalyticSurfaces1963} and later refined by A. Neron \cite{neronModelesMinimauxVarietes1964}.

This chapter is mostly based on \cite[][\S 8]{silvermanAdvancedTopicsArithmetic1994}. Occasionally \cite[sec.\ 10.2]{liuAlgebraicGeometryArithmetic2002} was referenced, where they do not assume that the residue field $k$ is algebraically closed. 
We will assume that $k$ is algebraically closed as that is the context that we use when we apply the results of this chapter in \cref{chap:a_berkovich_approach_to_classifying_elliptic_curves}.

\section{Notation and conventions} \label{sec:notation_and_conventions}

Throughout the this chapter $R$ will be a discrete valuation ring with maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m} = (\pi) $, such that the residue field $k := R / \mathfrak{m} $ is algebraically closed and $K$ is the fraction field of $R$. 

We let $E$ be an elliptic curve over $K$, and we let $\mathscr E$ be its minimal regular model. 
The irreducible components of $\mathscr E$ are $F_1, \ldots, F_r$ with respective multiplicities $N_1, \ldots, N_r$. 
So as divisors we have  
\begin{equation}\label{eq:decomposition_fibre}
	\mathscr E_s = \sum_{i = 0}^{r} N_i F_i.
\end{equation}
