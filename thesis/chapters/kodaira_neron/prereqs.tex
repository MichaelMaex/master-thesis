Before we start the partial proof of the classification we gather the important results from intersection theory in the following lemma. 
\begin{lemma}
	\label{prop:irred_comp_of_prop_model}
	Let $E, \mathscr E$ be the elliptic curve and model from \cref{sec:notation_and_conventions}. 
	Let $K_{\mathscr E}$ be a canonical divisor on $E$. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item At least one irreducible component has multiplicity $N_i = 1$.  
		\item $\mathscr E_s$ is connected. 
		\item $K_{\mathcal{C} } \cdot \mathscr E_s = 0 $. 
			Here $K_{\mathcal{C} }$ is a canonical divisor. 
		\item If $r = 1$ (i.e.\ the special fiber is irreducible) then $F_1^2 = \mathscr{E} _s^2 = 0$ and $g (F_1) = 1$. 
		\item If $r \ge 2$ (i.e.\ the special fiber is reducible) then for each irreducible component $F_i$ we have \[
		F_i^2 = -2,\quad  F_i \simeq \pro^{1}_k \quad \text{ and }\quad \sum_{1 \le j \le r, j \ne i}^{} N_j F_j\cdot  F_i = 2 N_i
		.\]   
	\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item As $E$ is an elliptic curve, it has at least one $K$-rational point $x$.
		Then by \cref{cor:closure_K_rational_point} we know that  $\red_{\mathscr E}(x)$ lies on a irreducible component of $\mathscr E_s$. 
	\item By \cite[cor.\ 9.1.24]{liuAlgebraicGeometryArithmetic2002} the map $\mathscr E \to R$ is $\mathcal{O}$-connected. 
		In particular  $\mathscr E_s$ is connected. 
	\item From \cref{prop:intersection_canonical_special} know that \[
			K_{\mathscr E} \cdot \mathscr E_{s} = 2g(E) - 2 = 0
	.\]  
	\item If $r = 1$ then $\mathscr E_s$ has only one irreducible component, $F_1$. 
		By the first part this component has multiplicity $N_1 = 1$. 
		So $\mathscr E_s = F_1$. 
		Then $\mathscr E_s^2 = F_1^2 = 0$. 
		As $\mathscr E \to \spec R$ is flat we know that $g(E)  = g(\mathscr E_s) = 1$.
	\item 	
		The adjunction formula (\cref{thm:adjunction_formula}) states that \begin{equation}\label{eq:proof_prereqs_1}
			F_i^2 + K_{\mathscr E} \cdot F_i = 2g(F_i) - 2
		.\end{equation}
		Suppose for the sake of contradiction that that $F_i^2 = 0$. 
		Then $F_i$ does not intersect any other components, and so $F_i$ is the only component of $\mathscr E_s$. 
		This contradicts $r \ge 2$. 
		We find that $F_i^2 \le -1$. 
		
		Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $K_\mathscr E \cdot F_i < 0$. 
		Then by \eqref{eq:proof_prereqs_1} this is only possible if $F_i^2 = -1$ and $g(F_i) =0$. 
		Thus $F_i$ is contractible by Castelnuovo's criterion, which contradicts the minimality of $\mathscr E$. 

		So for every $i$ we find that $F_i^2 \le 1, K_{\mathscr E} \cdot F_i \le 0$. 
		But \[
		0 = K_{\mathscr E} \cdot \mathscr E_s = \sum_{i = 1}^{r} K_{\mathscr E} \cdot F_i \le 0
		.\]  
		Hence  $K_{\mathscr E} \cdot F_i = 0$ for all $i$. 
		So \eqref{eq:proof_prereqs_1} becomes \[
			-1 \ge  F^2_i = 2g(F_i) - 2 \ge -2
		,\]  
		which can only hold if $F_i^2 = -2, g(F_i) = 0$. 

		The last equality is \cref{cor:compute_self_intersection}, together with $F_i^2 = -2$. 
\end{enumerate}	
\end{proof}
