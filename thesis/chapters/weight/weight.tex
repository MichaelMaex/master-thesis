In \cref{chap:intro_berkovich} the only analytic curves were able study were the projective line and its affinoid domains like balls and annuli.
Studying these spaces was possible because we had the Berkovich classification  theorem (\cref{thm:}) which gave an explicit discription of the semi-norms on $K[t]$. 
For other varieties, in particular curves it is not as easy to describe all norms.
The solution to this is to understand the relation between models of a variety and it's Berkovich analytification. 


In this chapter we cover the theory of weight functions, skeleta and the relation between models of a variety and its analytification described in the papers \cite{mustataWeightFunctionsNonArchimedean2015, nicaiseBerkovichSkeletaBirational2016, bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016}.
We won't do this in full detail, and often restict ourselves to the case of curves.
This theory works under the assumption that $K$ is discretely valued. 
A similar theory relating models of curves and Berkovich spaces in the case where $K$ is algebraically closed is developed in \cite{bakerStructureNonarchimedeanAnalytic2013}. 
While we won't cover this theory, a motivated reader might want to look into it, as it helps to understand our case conceptually.
