In \cref{chap:intro_berkovich} the only analytic curves we studied in detail were the projective line and its affinoid domains like balls and annuli.
Studying these spaces was possible because we had the Berkovich classification  theorem (\cref{thm:berkovich_classification}) which gives an explicit description of the semi-norms on $K[t]$. 
For other varieties, in particular curves it is not as easy to describe all norms.
The solution to this is to understand the relation between models of a variety and its Berkovich analytification. 


In this chapter we cover the theory of weight functions, skeleta and the relation between models of a variety and its analytification described in the papers \cite{mustataWeightFunctionsNonArchimedean2015, nicaiseBerkovichSkeletaBirational2016, bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016}.
We won't do this in full detail, and often restrict ourselves to the case of curves.
This theory works under the assumption that $K$ is discretely valued. 
A similar theory relating models of curves and Berkovich spaces in the case where $K$ is algebraically closed is described in \cite{bakerStructureNonarchimedeanAnalytic2013}. 
While we won't cover this theory, a motivated reader might want to look into it, as it aids our conceptual understanding of Berkovich analytic curves.
