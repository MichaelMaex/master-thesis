Recall $\Gamma_\lambda$ from \cref{fig:configurations_of_gamma_lambda}. 
Let $\delta = f_* \ram f$ which as a divisor on $\pro^{1}_K$ is the sum of the points on $\pro^{1}_K$ corresponding to $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$. 
\subsection{Finding a minimal scn model} \label{sec:finding_a_minimal_scn_model}
We can build a snc-model $\mathscr P$ of the pair $(\pro^{1}_K, \delta)$, i.e.\ $\mathscr P_s + \overline{\delta}$ is a strict normal crossings divisor, such that the associated skeleton $\sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$ in $\pro^{1}_K$ is exactly $\Gamma_\lambda$. 
The skeleton associated to a pair is defined in \cite[ยง3.2.1]{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016}.

We write $\pro^{1}_K = \spec K[x] \cup \spec K[\frac{1}{x}]$.
If $n = 0$ we can choose $\mathscr P = \pro^{1}_R$. Then the special fibre is $\pro^{1}_k$ and the points $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$ reduce to the distinct points $\overline{0}, \overline{1}, \overline{\lambda}, \overline{\infty}$.
So $\bar{\delta} + \pro^{1}_k$ is an snc-divisor on $\mathscr P$. 
See \cref{fig:model_pair_n_1}.

    \label{fig:model_pair_n_1}
\end{figure}

Let 
\begin{align}\label{eq:singular_model_pair}
	\mathscr P' &= \spec \frac{R[x, y]}{(xy - \pi^{n})} \cup \spec \frac{R\left[ \frac{1}{x},y \right]}{\left(y-\frac{\pi^{n}}{x}\right)} \cup \spec \frac{R\left[x, \frac{1}{y}\right]}{\left(x - \frac{\pi^{n}}{y}\right)} \\
	&=  \spec \frac{R[x, y]}{(xy - \pi^{n})} \cup \spec R\left[ \frac{1}{x} \right] \cup \spec R\left[ \frac{1}{y}\right] \nonumber 
 \end{align} 
This is a projective model of $\pro^{1}_K$. 
The special fibre on one the first affine chart is \[
	\spec k \times _{R} \spec \frac{R[x, y]}{(xy -\pi^{n})}=\spec  \frac{k[x, y]}{(xy)}
.\] 
Hence $\mathscr P'_s$ are two rational curves intersecting in one point. 
Let $F, G$ be the irreducible components cut out by $x, y$ respectively, which are given by the third and second chart in \eqref{eq:singular_model_pair} respectively. 
Note that $\mathscr P'$ is not regular at the intersection point.

The reduction of $0$ is the Zariksi closure of $V(x) = V(\pi ^{n} x ) = V(\frac{1}{y})$. 
So we see that $0$ reduces to the origin of the 3'rd affine chart in \eqref{eq:singular_model_pair}, i.e.\ a smooth point on $F$. 
Likewise  $V(x - \lambda) = V(\pi^{-n} x - \pi^{-n}\lambda) = V(\frac{1}{y} - \pi^{-n}\lambda)$. 
So $\lambda$ reduces to a point on $F$ as well, different from $\overline{0}$.
The reduction of $1$ is the Zariski closure of $V(x-1) = V(\frac{1}{x} - 1)$. 
So it lays on $G$. The reduction of $0$ is cut out by $V(\frac{1}{x})$ so it also lays on $G$. 

So we find that $0, \lambda$ reduce to distinct points on $F$ and $1, \infty$ reduce to distinct points on $G$. 
Let $\mathscr P$ be the minimal desingularisation of $\mathscr P'$. 
By \cite[cor.\ 9.3.25]{liuAlgebraicGeometryArithmetic2002} we find that $\mathscr P$ is $\mathscr P'$ where the intersection point is replaced by a chain of $n-1$ rational curves of multiplicity 1 and self intersection $-2$.  
So $\mathscr P$ is a chain of $n + 1$ rational curves. See \cref{fig:model_of_the_pair}. 

This is in fact the minimal snc-model of $(\pro^{1}_K, \delta)$ as the middle components can't be contracted and contracting $\tilde F$ or $\tilde G$ to get $\mathscr P''$, would cause either $0, \lambda$ or $1, \infty$ to be reduced to the same piont. Hence $\delta + \mathscr P''_s$ would no longer be an snc-divisor.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Computing the skeleton} \label{sec:computing_the_skeleton}

The dual graph of $\mathscr P$ is a path of $n + 1$ vertices, where each edge has length $1$. 
So geometrically $\Delta(\mathscr P)$ is a line of length $n$ if $n > 0$ and a point if $n = 0$.
Let $a, b$ the start and end points of the line, corresponding to the components $\tilde F$ and $\tilde G$ respectively. If $n = 0$ (i.e. $\Delta(\mathscr P)$ is a point) then we let $a = b = \sk(\mathscr P)$. 

Then the paths from $0$ and  $\lambda$ to $\sk(\mathscr P)$ come together at $b$. We see this because $0$ and $\lambda$ both reduce to points on $\tilde G$. 
As they reduce to different points, they paths to $\sk(\mathscr P)$ come it at $b$ from different tangent directions. 
Similarly the paths from $0$ and $\infty$ to $\sk(\mathscr P)$ come together at $a$.

So $\sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$ consists of the paths running running between every pair of $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$. Thus $\Gamma_\lambda \subset \sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$ as $\Gamma_\lambda$ is the convex hull of $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$.
As $\sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$ only leaves are $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$ we also get the converse $\Gamma_\lambda \subset  \sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$. 
So we found a snc-model $\mathscr P$ of $(\pro^{1}_K, \delta)$ such the associated skeleton equals $\Gamma_\lambda$.

\subsection{$\sk(\mathscr P)$ is a Kontsevich-Soibelman skeleton} \label{sec:$\sk(\mathscr_p)$_is_a_kontsevich-soibelman_skeleton}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:unique_form_pair}
	There is a rational section $\omega$ of $\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K}^{\otimes 2}$ with poles at  $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$ and no other zeros or other poles. 
	Moreover this rational section is unique up to multiplication by $K$ and the poles are of order 1. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	The statement is equivalent to showing that $\dim_K H^{0}(\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K}^{\otimes 2}(\delta))  = 1$.
	We have that $\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K} \simeq \mathcal{O}(-2)$ and $\mathcal{O}(\delta) \simeq \mathcal{O}(\deg \delta) = \mathcal{O}(4)$.
	So \[
		\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K} (\delta) \simeq \mathcal{O}(-1)^{\otimes 2} \otimes \mathcal{O}(4) \simeq \mathcal{O}\left(0 \right)  = \mathcal{O}_X
	.\] 
	Hence $H^{0}(\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K}^{\otimes 2}(\delta)$ is a $1$-dimensional $K$-vectorspace. 
\end{proof}

The proof of the following two results depend heavily on \cite[thm.\ 3.2.3]{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016}. 
	The metric on $\mathbb{H}(\pro^{1}_K)$ we defined in \cref{sec:}\todo{fill in the section/definition} (the stable metric) differs from the metric in used in \cite{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016} (the potential metric). 
	However, as we are interested in computing the minimal locus of $\wt_\omega$ by looking at its slopes, the spefic matters in our calculations. 
	So in the next two proof I'll use the potential metric instead of rescaling the slopes.

	The first lemma is a slight refinement of \cite[prop.\ 4.4.4]{mustataWeightFunctionsNonArchimedean2015} in the context of curves.
	\begin{lemma}\label{lem:well_behaved_pole_weight}
	Let $C$ be a curve over $K$ and $\omega$ be a $m$-pluricanonical form.
	Let $\mathrm{Pole}_\omega$ be the divisor that contains all points of $\omega$ and $\mathscr C$ a snc model of the pair $(\mathscr C, \omega)$.  
	If all the poles of $\omega$ are of degree less than $m$, then for all $x \in \pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ \[
		\wt_\omega(x) \ge \wt_\omega(\rho_{\mathscr C}(x))
	\] 
	with equality if and only if $x \in \sk(\mathscr C)$. 
	\todo{define the reduction map in this sense}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	If $\red_{\mathscr C}(x)$ does not lie in the closure of $\mathrm{Pole}_\omega$ then the result follows from \cite[prop.\ 4.4.4.(2)]{mustataWeightFunctionsNonArchimedean2015} and the denseness of divisorial points. 

	If $\red_{\mathscr C}(x)$ lies in the closure of some pole $z \in \mathrm{Pole}_\omega$. 
	Let $\ell: [0, a] \to X\an$ be the path running from $\sk \mathscr C$ to $x$, parametrised by length. 
	By assumption this path coincides with the path $m: [0, \infty) : X\an$ from $\mathscr C$ to $z$, also parametrized by $\length$.
	Let $\epsilon$ be the length where $m, \ell$ branch. 
	The slope on  $\ell|_{[0, \epsilon]}$ is positive by \cite[thm.\ 3.2.3.(2)]{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016} , hence $\wt_\omega \ell(\epsilon) > \wt_\omega \red_{\mathscr C}(x)$.
	If $\epsilon = a$ we are done. 
	If $\epsilon < a$ then repeatedly blowing up $\mathscr C$ in the reduction of $z$ yields a model $\mathscr C'$ whose dual graph contains $\ell(\epsilon)$, but does not contain $x$.
	So the result now follows from applying \cite[prop.\ 4.4.4.(2)]{mustataWeightFunctionsNonArchimedean2015} to the model $\mathscr C'$. 
	\todo{cleanup this proof}
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	Let $\omega$ be as in \cref{lem:unique_form_pair} and $\mathscr P$ the model constructed in \cref{sec:finding_a_minimal_scn_model}.
	Then $\sk(\pro^{1}_K, \omega) = \sk(\mathscr P)$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	\Cref{lem:well_behaved_pole_weight} implies that $\minloc \wt_{w} = \sk(C, \omega) \subset \sk(\mathscr P) $. 
	If $n = 0$ we are done as $\sk(\mathscr P) $ is a point. 
	Suppose that $n > 1$ ($\sk(\mathscr P)$ is a line), then 
	it suffices to show that $\wt_\omega$ is constant on $\sk(\mathscr P)$, i.e.\ constant on the line segment $[ab]$ in \cref{fig:skeleton_of_the_pair}. 
	By \cite[thm.\ 3.2.3.(3)]{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016} we know that the laplacian of $\wt_\omega$ restricted to $\sk(\mathscr P, \delta)$ is given by \[
		\Delta\left(\wt_\omega|_{\sk(\mathscr P, \delta)}\right) = 2\cdot \sum_{v \in \sk(\mathscr P, \delta)} N(v)(\val (g) - 2g(v) - 2)v = 2a + 2b
	.\] 
	At $a$ the lines $[0, a],[\lambda, a]$ and  $[a, b]$ meet. 
	The outgoing slopes of  $[0, a], [\lambda, a]$ are both $1$ by \cite[3.2.3.(2)]{bakerWeightFunctionsBerkovich2016}. 
	This implies that the outgoing slop at $a$ on the line$ [a, b]$ is $0$. 
	As the laplacian has no points on the interior of $[a, b]$ the slope remains constant on $[a, b]$ and we are done. 
\end{proof}
