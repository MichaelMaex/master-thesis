If $\ch k =2$ we can no longer use \cref{prop:weightfunction_fullback} to show that  $\sk(E) = \phi^{-1}(\sk(\mathscr P))$. 
In fact, as we will see in this section, the conclusion $\sk(E) = \phi^{-1}(\sk(\mathscr P))$ is false in many cases that we work out.  
But by a closer examination of Tate's algorithm we can still identify $\phi(\sk(E))$ as a subbset of $ \pro_K^{1, \text{an}}$. 
This allows us to make some conjectures about the behavior of the error term $\mathfrak{d}_f$ from \cref{rem:weightfunction_fullback_art}. 


Recall that in \cref{sec:char_k_is_2} we found that \begin{equation}\label{eq:wild_minimal_weierstrass}
E: y_{3i}^2 - 2_i x_{2i} y_{3i} = x_{2i}^3 + (-2_{2i} - \lambda_{2i}) x_{2i}^2 + \lambda_{4i} x_{2i}
,\end{equation} 
with \[
	y_{3i} = \pi^{-3i} y,\quad x_{2i} = \pi^{-2i} x, \quad i = \min\left( \left\lfloor \frac{v(2)}{2}\right\rfloor, \left\lfloor \frac{n}{4} \right\rfloor  \right), \quad 2 = v\cdot \pi^{v(2)},\quad  \lambda = u \cdot \pi^{n}
.\] 
is a minimal Weierstrass equation for $E$ if $n < v(2)$ or $n > v(2) \wedge 2 \nmid v(2)$, as Tate's algorithm ends after only one iteration. 

We will have to split up differerent cases. 
\subsection{The case $v(\lambda) > 2v(2)$ and $v(2)$ is odd} \label{sec:case_v_lambda_>_2_v_2_and_v_2_is_even}
In this case we have $i = (v(2) - 1) / 2$ and we computed that $E$ is of type $\mathrm I_{2n - 4v(2)}^*$ (\cref{prop:tate_char_is_2}).
Let $\mathscr E_\text{min} $ be the minimal regular model of $E$ (which for curves of type $\mathrm I_m^*$ coincides with the minimal snc-model).
The idea is to look at the proof of Tate's algorithm where they compute each component of $\mathscr E_\text{min} $ explicitly by repeatedly blowing up the Weierstrass equation \eqref{eq:wild_minimal_weierstrass}. 
Then for each component, we can look for a corresponding model of $\pro^{1}_K$ with a single component and a dominating map between the components. 
That way we can find the image of every divisorial point in $\Delta(\mathscr E_\text{min} )$ in $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$. 
Fortunately the necessary blowups are computed very clearly in the proof of Tate's algorithm in \cite[p.\ 369-379]{silvermanAdvancedTopicsArithmetic1994}

Note that in \cref{sec:char_k_is_2}, in the case where $n > 2v(2)$ and $v(2)$ is odd, we did not perform any coordinate translations by the time we reached step 7 of the algorithm. 
At the end of p.\ 372 Silverman writes that in his notation $x_{r} = \pi^{-r}x, y_{r} = \pi^{-r}y$, where $x, y$ are the original coordinates of the Weierstrass equation after translation.
We started the algorithm with a Weierstrass equation with variables $x_{2i}, y_{3i}$. 
So where Silverman writes $(x_r, y_r)$ in our notation that becomes $(x_{2i+ r}, y_{3i + r})$. 
In the proof of step 5, he starts with the model $\mathcal{V} $ which we will call $\mathcal{V} _{-1}$ and (on an affine chart) looks like 
\[
	\begin{aligned}	
	\mathcal{V}_{-1} = \spec \frac{R[x_{2i + 1}, y_{3i + 3}]}{(y_{3i + 3}^2 + 2_i x_{2i + 1}y_{3i + 3} = \pi x_{2i + 1}^3 + \pi v x_{2i + 1}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 1} x_{2i + 1})} \\ 
	\longrightarrow \mathcal{P} _{-1} = \spec R[x_{2i + 1}]
	\end{aligned}
,\] 
Note that we added the projection to the $x$-axis, which resulted in a model $\mathcal P_{-1}$ of $\pro^{1}_K$.  
On the special fibers this looks like 
\[
	\mathcal{V}_{-1,s} = \spec \frac{k[x_{2i + 1}, y_{3i + 3}]}{(y_{3i+3}^2)} \to \spec k[x_{2i + 1}]
.\] 
We see that the double line $y_{3i + 3}^2 = 0$ maps surjectively on $k[x _{2i + 1}]$. 
So the image of this component in $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is the point given by the disk $B(0, |\pi|^{2i + 1})$ (\cref{lem:model_disk_proj_line}).


Then he blows up $\mathcal{V}_{-1} $ in $(0, 0, 0)$ to obtain the scheme
\[
	\mathcal{V}_0  = \spec \frac{R[x_{n_0}, y_{m_0}]}{(\pi y_{n_0} ^2 + \pi2_{i + 1} x_{n_0} y_{n_0} = x_{n_0}^3 +  a_{2,1} x_{n_0}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 2} x_{n_0}^2)} 
,\] 
where we used the notation \[
	n_j = 2i + 1 + \left\lfloor \frac{j + 1}{2} \right\rfloor,\quad  m_j = 3i + 2 + \left\lfloor \frac{j }{2} \right\rfloor
.\]
Let $a, b \in R$ be such that $0, a, b$ are the roots of $x_{n_0}^3 +  a_{2,1} x_{n_0}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 2} x_{n_0}^2$ and $\overline{a} = 0, \overline{b} = \overline{a_{2,1}} = \overline{v}$.  
These exist because over $k$ the polynomial looks like $x_{n_0}^3 + \overline{v} x_{n_0}^2$ and by Hensel's lemma the roots lift. 

We can define a birational map of schemes \[
	\mathcal{V}_0 \birat \mathcal{P} _{0} = \spec \frac{R[x_{n_0}, z]}{(z x_{n_0}(x_{n_0} - a) - \pi)},\quad
	x_{n_0} \mapsto x_{n_0}, z\mapsto \frac{(x - b)}{y_{n_0}^2 + 2_{i + 1} x_{n_0}y_{n_0} }
.\] 
The morphism on the special fibre is given by \[
	\mathcal{V} _{0, s} = \spec \frac{k[x_{n_0}, y_{m_0}]}{(x^3_{n_0} + \overline{v} x^2_{n_0})} \birat \frac{k[x_{n_1}, z_0]}{(z_0 \cdot x_{n_0}^2)}
.\] 
So we see that the double line cute out by $x_{n_0}^2 = 0$ in the source maps to the double line cut out by $x_{n_0}^2 = 0$ in the image. 

In the proof of step 6 and 7 he continues with the models $\mathcal{V} _j$ which for our coefficients and $2 \nmid j, j\le 2n - 4v(2) - 1$ looks like . 
\[
	\begin{aligned}
	\mathcal{V} _j = \spec \frac{R[x_{n_{j}}, y_{m_j}]}{(y_{m_j}^2 + \pi 2_{i + 1} x_{n_j}y_{m_j} = \pi^2 x_{n_j}^3 + \pi a_{2, 1} x_{n_j}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 2 + \left\lfloor j / 2 \right\rfloor} x_{n_j}) } \\ 
	\longrightarrow  \mathcal{P} _{j} = \spec R[x_{n_j}]
	\end{aligned}
.\] 
Note that we again added the projection to the $x_{n_j}$-axis. 
Then the map on special fibers looks like \[
	\mathcal{V} _{j, s} = \spec \frac{R[x_{n_j}, y_{m_j}]}{(y_{m_j}^2)} \to \spec k[x_{n_j}]
.\] 
Thus the double line given by $y_{m_j}^2 = 0$ maps surjectively onto the line $\spec k[x_{n_j}]$. 
So the image of the divisorial point of $\mathcal{V} _j$ in $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is the point corresponding to the disk $B(0, |\pi|^{2i + 1 + \frac{j + 1}{2}})$. 

For $2 \mid j, j \le 2n - 4v(2) - 1$, the schemes $\mathcal{V} _j$ look like. 
\[
	\begin{aligned}
		\mathcal{V}_j = \spec \frac{R[x_{n_j},y_{m_j}]}{(\pi y^2_{m_j} + \pi 2_{{i + 1}}x_{2i}y_{n_j} = \pi x_{n_j}^3 + a_{2,1}x_{n_j}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 2 + \left\lfloor j / 2 \right\rfloor} x_{n_j})} \\ \dashrightarrow  \mathcal{P} _{j} =  \spec \frac{R[ x_{n_j}, z_j]}{(z_j(a_{2,1} x_{n_j}^2 + \lambda_{4i + 2 + \left\lfloor j / 2 \right\rfloor})- \pi)} 
	\end{aligned}
,\]
where the birational map is given by $x_{n_j} \mapsto  x_{n_j}, z \mapsto (y^2_{m_j} + 2_{i + 1 }x_{m_j}y_{n_j} -  x_{n_j}^3)^{-1}$. 
On the level of special fibers this is given by \[
	\mathcal{V} _{j, s} = \spec \frac{k[x_{n_j}, y_{n_j}]}{(\overline{v}x^2_{n_j})} \birat \spec \frac{k[x_{n_j}, z_j]}{(z_j \cdot  x^2_{n_j})}
,\]
where we see that the double line cut out by  $x_{n_j}^2 = 0$ in the source dominates the double line $x_{n_j}^2 = 0$ in the image. 


\bigskip

The models $\mathcal{V} , \mathcal{V} _{0}, \ldots, \mathcal{V} _{2n - 4v(2) - 1}$ give all of the $2n - 4v(2) + 1$ multiplicity two components of  $\mathscr E_\text{min} $. 
Lets call these divisorial points $\alpha_{-1}, \alpha_0, \ldots, \alpha_{2n-2v(2) - 1}$ respectively. 
We write $\beta_j = \phi(\alpha_j)$. 
Furthermore, for each of these models, we have given a map to a normal model $\mathcal{P} _{j}$ of $\pro^{1}_{K}$. 
For odd $j$ we use d this to identify $\beta_j$ as the point corresponding to the disk $B(0, |\pi|^{2i + 1 + \frac{j + 1}{1}})$.
So $\beta_{-1}, \beta_1, \beta_{3}, \ldots, \beta_{2n - 4v(2) - 1}$ adjacent vertices in $\Delta(\mathscr P)$, starting at length $v(2)$ below $b$, and ending at $v(2)$ above $a$ (recall \cref{fig:skeleton_of_the_pair}).

It should be possible to give a similar algebraic argument for $\beta_{j}$ when $j$ is even.
But instead of computing the divisorial points associated to the double line $x_{n_j} = 0^2$ in $\mathcal{P} _j$, we can find $\beta_j$ entirely from a Berkovich geometric argument. 
This argument again uses the number and distribution of divisorial points of a given degree on a line in $\sk(E)$ and $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$.
We do this to show that even in this the wildly ramified setting, we can use Berkovich geometric arguments. 
The argument is very topological, so it is best to follow along on \cref{fig:argument_ims_wild}.

\medskip

Without loss of generality we will determine $\beta_0$ using what we know about $\beta_{-1}$ and $\beta_1$. 
As we've seen $\beta_{-1}, \beta_{1}$ are adjacent vertices in $\Delta(\mathscr P)$. 
There is a unique point $\gamma$ on $(\beta_{-1}, \beta_1)$ such that $N(\gamma) = 2$.  
We expect that like in \cref{sec:determining_m_when_e_is_of_type_ims} $\phi(\alpha_0) = \beta_0 = \gamma$. 
Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $\beta_0 \ne \gamma$.



As $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is a uniquely geodesic space, we know that $\phi((\alpha_{-1}, \alpha_{1}))$ contains the entire line  $(\beta_{-1}, \beta_1)$. 
Further more, as $\alpha_{-1}$ is a multiplicity 2 point, mapping to the multiplicity 1 point $\beta_{-1}$, \cref{rem:balancing_galois_cover} tells us that $\alpha_{-1}$ is the unique preimage of $\beta_{-1}$. 
Likewise $\alpha_1$ is the unique preimage of $\beta_1$. 
So the $\phi((\alpha_{-1}, \alpha_{1}))$ is contained in the open annulus $A$ bounded by $\beta_{-1}, \beta_1$.
Note that the only divisorial points of multiplicity 2 in $A$ are $\gamma$ and in horizontal branches originating in $\gamma$. There are no multiplicity 1 points in  $A$. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \incfig{argument-ims-wild}
    \caption{Finding $\beta_0 = \phi(\alpha_0)$ in $\pro^{1,\text{an}}_{K}$. 
    Note that this figure is inaccurate as it is part of a proof by contradiction.}
    \label{fig:argument_ims_wild}
\end{figure}
As $\phi((\alpha_{-1}, \alpha_{1}))$ contains the entire line $(\beta_{-1}, \beta_1)$ we know that $\gamma$ has a preimage in that line, which by \cref{rem:balancing_galois_cover} is either of multiplicity $2$ or $4$. 
We've assumed it is not $\beta_0$, the only point of multiplicity 2 in  $(\beta_{-1}, \beta_1)$.
So one of the two multiplicity 4 points must map to $\gamma$. 
Let $\delta$ be the multiplicity 4 point on $(\alpha_0, \alpha_1)$ and suppose without loss of generality that $\phi(\delta) = \gamma$. 
By \cref{rem:balancing_galois_cover} we know that $\delta$ is the unique preimage of $\gamma$. 

So $\phi(\alpha_0)$ must be a point of multiplicity 1 or 2. As there are no points of multiplicity $1$ in $A$ and we assumed $\phi(\alpha_0)\ne \gamma$ we find that that $\phi(\alpha_0) = \beta_0$ must be on one of the branches coming of $\gamma$. 
Again using the fact that $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is uniquely geodesic we know that $(\beta_0, \gamma] \cup [\gamma, \beta_{-1}) \subset  \phi((\gamma, \alpha_{-1}))$. 
So $\gamma$ has a preimage different from $\delta$ on $(\gamma, \alpha_{-1})$. 
This is a contradiction. 
Thus $\phi(\beta_0) = \gamma$. 

Putting together everything we know about $\beta_{-1}, \ldots, \beta_{2n - 4v(2)-1}$ we see that $\sk(E)$ maps onto a line inside $\sk(\mathscr P)$ with length $n- 2v(2)$ whose start and end points are at distance $v(2)$ from $a, b$.
See \cref{fig:image_between_skeleta_wild_ims}.
\begin{figure}[h]

\end{figure}

\subsection{The case where $n < 2 v(2)$} \label{sec:the_case_where_n_<_2_v2}


Let $g: \pro^{1}_K \to \pro^{1}_K$ be the automorphism induced by $x \mapsto \lambda / x$. 
Consider the Weierstrass equation of $E$ and multiply both sides by $\lambda^2 x^{-4}$.
Then 
\[
\begin{aligned}
	y^2 &=  x(x-1)(x-\lambda) \\
	\left(\lambda x^{-2}y\right)^2 &= \frac{\lambda}{x}\left(\lambda - \frac{\lambda}{x} \right)\left(1 - \frac{\lambda}{x}\right)
\end{aligned}
,\] 
which is the Weierstrass equation of an isomorphic elliptic curve. 
So  $g$ extends to an automorphism of $h: E \to E$ given by the coordinate transform $x \mapsto \frac{\lambda}{x}, y\mapsto \lambda x^{-2}y$. 
Thus we have the following commutative diagram.
\[
\begin{tikzcd}
	E \rar{h} \dar{f} & E \dar{f} & & 
	E\an \rar{h\an} \dar{\phi} & E\an \dar{\phi} \\
	\pro^{1}_K \rar{g} & \pro^{1}_K & & \pro^{1, \text{an }}_K \rar{g\an} & \pro^{1, \text{an}}_K
\end{tikzcd}
.\] 

On $\pro^{1}_K$, $g$ is the map that maps $0 \leftrightarrow \infty, 1 \leftrightarrow \lambda$. 
Its fixed points are $\sqrt{\lambda}, -\sqrt{\lambda}$ (which are not necessarily $K$-points).
So we see that $g\an$ leaves $\Gamma_\lambda$ invariant. In particular $\sk(\mathscr P)$ is a fixed set of $g\an$, but $g\an$ flips the orientation of $\sk(\mathscr P)$, i.e. $g\an(a) = b, g\an(b) = a$. 
As $h$ is an automorphism and the essential skeleton is canonical, $\sk(E)$ a fixed set of $h\an$. 
The minimal snc-model of $E$ must also be invariant under $h$. 
So $\sk(\mathscr E_\text{min} )$ is also a fixed set under $h$. 
Thus $\phi(\sk(E)), \phi(\sk(\mathscr E_\text{min} )$ are fixed sets of $g\an$.


Let $c$ be the mid point of $\sk(\mathscr P)$. 
If $n$ is even we see that $c$ is a multiplicity 1 point. 
If $n$ is odd then $c$ is a multiplicity $2$ point. 

Then fixed points of $g\an$ are the lines  $[\sqrt{\lambda}, c] \cup [-\sqrt{\lambda} , c]$ where $\sqrt{\lambda}, -\sqrt{\lambda}$ are the closed points in $\pro^{1}_K$ (they are possibly the same point). 
Note that these lines branch off in the same tangent direction at $c$ as the reduction map at that point maps both directions to  $\sqrt{\overline{u}} $ in $k$. 

Let $w$ be the divisorial points associated to the Weierstrass component of $\mathscr E_\text{min} $. 
Then by projecting the model from \cref{eq:wild_minimal_weierstrass} to the $x$-axis we see that $\phi(x)$ is given by the disk $B(0, |\pi|^{2i})$. 
Note that $w$ is not a fixed point of $h\an$ as the reduced Weierstrass equation is not unique and we always let $w$ be the point given by the model in \cref{eq:wild_minimal_weierstrass}. 
The image $h(w)$ is still given by a multiplicity one component on $\mathscr E_\text{min} $.

\subsubsection{If $n$ is even} \label{sec:if_$n$_is_even}

If  $n \equiv 0 \mod 4$ then $E$ is of type $\mathrm{II}$.  
So $\sk(E)$ is a single point of multiplicity 6. 
Therefore  $\phi(\sk(E))$ is a fixed point of $g\an$. 
So $\sk(E) \in [\sqrt{\lambda}, c] \cup [-\sqrt{\lambda}, c] $, but $\phi(\sk(E)) \ne c$ as a multiplicity 6 point must map to a multiplicity 3 or 6 point, under a degree 2 Galois cover. 
So $\phi(\sk(E))$ is a point off the line $\sk(\mathscr P)$. 
See \cref{fig:image_skeleton_wild_n_le_2v2_n_even}. 

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \incfig{image-skeleton-wild-n-le-2v2-n-even}
    \caption{The embedding of $\sk(E)$ in $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ when $n < 2v(2)$ and  $n$ is even.}
    \label{fig:image_skeleton_wild_n_le_2v2_n_even}
\end{figure}
\medskip 
If $n \equiv 2 \mod 4$ then $E$ is of type $\mathrm I_{m}^*$ for some $m$. 
Note that at at step 7 we had to change coordinates $x_{i+1}' = x_{i + 1}  + s$ where $\overline{s} = \sqrt{\overline{u}} $. 
Following the same argument as in \cref{sec:case_v_lambda_>_2_v_2_and_v_2_is_even} we see that degree two components of $\mathscr E_\text{min} $ lie in a branch of $c$. 
But as we changed coordinates, they lay in the branch of $c$ with the same tangent direction as $\sqrt{\lambda} $. 
As the map $\phi|_{\mathscr E}$ is injective by the same argument as in \cref{sec:case_v_lambda_>_2_v_2_and_v_2_is_even} we further see that the $\phi(\sk(E))$ must lay on the line $[\sqrt{\lambda}, c] $ or $[-\sqrt{\lambda} , c]$
So again we find that $\phi(\sk (E))$ is not contained in $\sk(\mathscr P)$. 



\subsubsection{If $n \equiv 1 \mod 4$} \label{sec:if_n_equiv_1_mod_4$}

In this case we found that $E$ has reduction type $\mathrm{III}$. 
So $\sk(E)$ is a multiplicity 4 point. 
We see that $\phi(w)$ is the point on $[a, b]$ laying at distance $1 /2$ above $c$. 
Likewise  $g\an(\phi(w))$ lays at distance $1 / 2$ below $c$. 
So the line $\phi((w, h\an(w)))$ must contain the line $(\phi(w), g\an(\phi(w)))$ as  $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is uniquely geodesic. 
Then the preimage of $c$ must be a multiplicity 2 or 4 point. Thus it can only be the point $\gamma$ (see \cref{fig:type_iii_to_sk_p}), as all other points on $(w, h\an(w))$ have multiplicity strictly greater than  $4$. 
Then the image of $\delta$ must be a multiplicity 2  point in a vertical branch of $c$.
As $\delta$ is a fixed point of $h\an$, $\phi(\delta)$ is a fixed point of $g\an$ and lays on the line $[\sqrt{\lambda} , c] \cup [-\sqrt{\lambda} , c]$.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    \incfig{type-iii-to-sk-p}
    \caption{The embedding of $\sk(\mathscr E_\text{min}) $ and $\sk(E)$ in $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ if $n < 2v(2)$ and $n \equiv 1 \mod 4 $.}
    \label{fig:type_iii_to_sk_p}
\end{figure}



\subsubsection{If $n \equiv 3 \mod 4$ } \label{sec:if_n_equiv_3_mod_4}
In this case we found that $E$ has reduction type $\mathrm{III}^*$ if $n < 2v(2) -1$. 
We restrict ourselves to this case. 
We see that $\phi(w)$ is the point on $[a, b]$ laying at distance $3 /2$ above $c$. 
Likewise  $g\an(\phi(w))$ lays at distance $3/ 2$ below $c$. 
So in between $\phi(w)$ and $c$ there is a unique multiplicity 1 point $d$. 
Likewise in between $c$ and $g\an(\phi(w))$ the unique multiplicity 1 point is $g\an(d)$. 

So the line $\phi((w, h\an(w)))$ must contain the line $(\phi(w), g\an(\phi(w)))$ as  $\pro^{1, \text{an}}_K$ is uniquely geodesic. 
The preimages of $d, g\an (d$) must be the only two multiplicity 2 points on the line $(w, h\an(w))$. 
Then the preimage of $c$ must be the multiplicity 4 point, which is the only essential component of $\Delta(\mathscr E_\text{min} )$. 
So we see that $\phi(\sk(E)) = \{c\} $. 
Like the previous case we see that $\phi(\delta)$ must be a multiplicity 2 point in one of the lines $[\sqrt{\lambda} , c] \cup [-\sqrt{\lambda} , c]$. 
See \cref{fig:type_iiis_to_sk_p}.
