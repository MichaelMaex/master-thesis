In the case where $\ch k \ne 2$ we can use \cref{prop:weightfunction_fullback} to compare the skeleton $\sk(\mathscr P)$ with the essential skeleton $\sk(E)$. 
\begin{lemma}
	Let $\mathscr P$ be as in \cref{sec:a_weight_function_on_pro_1_k}, and $E$ from \cref{prob:main_problem}. 
	Then \[
		\sk(E) = \phi^{-1}(\sk(\mathscr P))
	.\] 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	In \cref{prop:model_P_is_KS} we saw that $\sk(\mathscr P) = \sk(P, \omega)$, where $\omega$ is the rational section of $\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K}^{\otimes 2}$ with poles at $0, 1, \lambda, \infty$, which is unique up to multiplication by $K$. 
	Then $f^* \omega$ is a $2$ pluricanonical form. 
	Indeed, we can take $\omega$ as a global section of $\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K}^{\otimes 2}(f_* \ram _f)$. 
	And 
	\[
		f^* (\Omega_{\pro^{1}_K / K}^{\otimes 2}(-f_* \ram _f)) = \Omega_{E /K}^{\otimes 2} \otimes \mathcal{O}(2 \ram_f) \otimes f^*f_* \mathcal{O}(-\ram _f) = \Omega_{E / K}
	.\] 
	We also have 
	\[
		\sk(E, f^*\omega) = \minloc \wt_{f^* \omega} = \minloc \wt_{\omega}\circ \phi = \phi^{-1}(\minloc \wt_\omega) = \phi^{-1} (\sk(\pro^{1}_K, \omega)
	.\] 
	Recall that $\Omega_{E / K}$ is trivial as $E$ is an elliptic curve. 
	So all pluricanonnical forms are the same up to multiplication. 
	So $\sk(E)$ can be computed using only one pluricanonical form, thus \[
		\sk(E) = \sk(E, f^*\omega) = \phi^{-1}(\sk(\pro^{1}_K, \omega)) = \phi^{-1}(\mathscr P)
	.\] 
\end{proof}

The following lemma is stated much more generally than we will need it. 
But it is a neat result, and the proof is neither long, nor complicated. So we put it in. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:number_divisorial_points}
	Let $\mathscr C$ be a snc-model of  $C$ and suppose that $e$ is an edge between two divisorial pionts of degree $1$ in $\Delta(\mathscr C)$. 
	Let $f(n)$ be the number of divisorial points of degree $n$ on the edge  $e$ in $\sk(\mathscr C)$. 
	Then \[
		f(n) = \begin{cases}
			2 & n = 1 \\
			\varphi(n) & n > 1
		\end{cases}
	,\] 
	where $\varphi$ is the Euler totient function. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	As the problem is local, we may assume that $\mathscr C$ is a (not proper) model with just two component of multiplicity $1$ intersecting in one point. 
	So $\sk(\mathscr C)$ is just the edge $e$. 

	Let $x$ be any divisorial point on $e$. 
	Then by the factorisation theorem $x$ can be obtained as the vertex in the dual graph of a snc-model, which is obtained by repeatedly blowing up in intersection points. 

	We now construct a sequence of snc-models \[
	\ldots \to 	\mathscr C_n \to \mathscr C_{n -1} \to \ldots \to \mathscr C_1 = \mathscr C
,\]
each dominating the previous as follows. 
The model  $\mathscr C_i$ is the blowup of $\mathscr C_{i-1}$ in all intersection points $\xi$ such that lies on two components with multiplicity $N, M$ and $N + M \le i$. 
Then $x$ is a vertex on $\Delta(\mathscr C_n)$ for sufficiently large $n$.
In the dual graph this repeatedly subdivides the edge in $e$ by adding more vertices of higher multiplicity. 
\\

We now obtain the result from noting that these multiplicities are exactly the denominators from the Farey sequence for which the result is a well known theorem. 
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:equality_lenghts_preserve_mult}
	Let $f: X \to Y$ be a finite morphism of curves and $p$ a path in $\sk(\mathscr X)\subset X\an $  such that $f\an|_p$ is injective and lands in $\sk(\mathscr Y)$ for some snc-models $\mathscr X, \mathscr Y$ of $X, Y$ respectively. 
	Suppose further that for every divisorial point $x \in p$  we have $N(x) = N(f\an(x))$. 
	Then $f\an(p)$ has the same length as $f\an$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	As the divisorial points are dense on the path $p$ we may assume that $p$ is a closed path that starts and ends in a divisorial point, $x, y$ respectively.
	By repeatedly blowing up in divisorial points we may replace $\mathscr X, \mathscr Y$ by models that such that $p$ and $\phi(p)$ are made up of a number of edges on $\sk(\mathscr X), \sk(\mathscr Y)$, respectively. 
	As the question is local we may replace $\mathscr X, \mathscr Y$ to opens in them such that $\sk(\mathscr X) = p, \sk(\mathscr Y) = f\an (p)$. (Note that $\mathscr X, \mathscr Y$ are no longer proper, but still have normal crossings).  
	Then $\Delta(\mathscr X)$ as a graph is a path ending and starting with vertex $x, y$ and $\Delta(\mathscr Y)$ is a path starting and ending with $f\an(x), f\an(y)$. 

	Let \[
		N = \max \{N(v) \st v \text{ is a vertex in } \Delta(\mathscr X) \text{ or } \Delta(\mathscr Y)\} 
	.\] 
	We will now describe how blowup $\mathscr X$ and $\mathscr Y$ repeatedly in intersection points such that the vertices in the dual graphs are precisely the divisorial points of multiplicity less than or equal to $N$. 

	Let \[
	\mathscr X_n \to \mathscr X_{n - 1} \to \ldots \to \mathscr \mathscr X_1 = \mathscr X
	\] 
	be a sequence of locally snc-models of  $X$, where $\mathscr X_i$ is the blowup of $\mathscr X_{i-1}$ in all intersection points of laying on components with multiplicity $N_1, N_2$ such that $N_1 + N_2 \le i$. 
	Note that all components in the expecptional divisor have multiplicity at most $i$. 

	Note that $\Delta(\mathscr X_1)$ contains all divisorial points in $\sk(\mathscr X)$ of multiplicity 1. If not, let $z$ be such a divisorial points. 
	Then we can repeatedly blowup $\mathscr X$ in intersection points to obtain $\mathscr X'$ such that $z$ is in $\Delta(\mathscr X')$. 
	But $z$ is the result of a blowup in an intersection point, and thus has multiplicity atleast $2$. 

	By induction we see that $\mathscr X_i$ contains all divisorial points in $\sk(\mathscr X)$ of multiplicity less than or equal to $i$, for $i = 1, \ldots, n$. 
	Indeed suppose that this is the case for $\mathscr X_{i -1}$ and $z$ is a divisorial point that we obtain by repeatedly blowing up intersection points.
	Then  $z$ lies between two adjacent vertices $v_1, v_2$ of multiplicity $N_1, N_2$ respectively in $\mathscr X_{i}$. 
	We easily see that $z$ has atleast multiplicity $N_1 + N_2$. 
	So it is sufficient to show that $N_1 + N_2 > i$. 
	Suppose for the sake of contradiction that $N_1 + N_2 \le i$.
	Then both $N_1 \le i -1$ and $N_2 \le i-1$. 
	So $v_1, v_2$ are vertices that also belong to $\Delta(\mathscr X_{i-1})$, and they are also adjacent. 
	But as $N_1 + N_2 \le i$ we know that $\Delta(\mathscr X_{i})$ has a vertex in between $v_1, v_2$. This contradicts that $v_1, v_2$ are adjacent in $\Delta(\mathscr X_{i})$. 

	Now we see that $\Delta(\mathscr X_n)$ contains all divisorial points in $\sk(\mathscr X) = p$ of multiplicity less than or equal to $n$. 
	As in the process no vertices of multiplicity higher than $n$ were added, we see that $\Delta(\mathscr X_n)$ contains exactly the vertices of multiplicity less than or equal to $n$. 

	Similarly we construct a model $\mathscr Y_n$ such that the vertices on  $\Delta(\mathscr Y_n)$ are exactly all divisorial points on $\sk(\mathscr Y) = f\an(p)$ of multiplicity less than or equal to $n$. 

	Let $V$ be the set of vertices on $\Delta(\mathscr X_n)$. 
	As $f\an $ on $p$ preserves multiplicity we see that $f\an(V)$ are precisely the vertices of $\Delta(\mathscr Y_n)$ and $f\an$ even preserves the order of the vertices. 
	So $f\an$ induces an isomorphism of graphs $\Delta(\mathscr X_n) \to \Delta(\mathscr Y_n)$ where each vertex is labeled with its multiplicity. 
	It follows from the definition of the length on a graph that $|\Delta(\mathscr X_n)| = p$ has the same length as $|\Delta(\mathscr Y_n)| = f\an(p)$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}\label{rem:length_edge_skeleton_cover}
	The main context in which the assumptions of \cref{lem:equality_lenghts_preserve_mult} are satisfied is when $f:X \to Y$ is a degree $d$ map of curves, $e$ is an edge in a skeleton of $Y$ such that $e \subset Y\an \setminus B_{f\an}$, and $e'$ is a lift of $e$ in $X\an$. 
	Here $B_{f\an}$ is the topological branch locus of the map $f\an: X\an \to Y\an$.
	Indeed, every divisorial point $x \in e$ has $d$ preimages, and by \cref{lem:}\todo{link back to this lemma} $x$ and it's preimages have the same multiplicity. 
	In this context we find that $e'$ and $e$ have the same length.
