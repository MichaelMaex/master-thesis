In this section we'll describe the category of $K$-analytic spaces, which is where the Berkovich spaces of schemes will live. 
The main building blocks of these spaces are affinoind algebras which are a type of complete $K$-algebras. 
These will also crucial for defining the structure sheaf on Berkovich spaces. 

\subsection{Banach Algebras} \label{sec:banach_algebras}
\todo{define completed tensor product}
\begin{definition}
	A $K$-banach space is a $K$-vector space equipped with a norm that is complete with respect to that norm. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A, B$ be $K$-banach spaces. 
	A $K$-vector space morphism $\phi: A \to B$ is \emph{bounded} if there is some $C\in \R$ such that $\|\phi(a)\|\le C \|a\| $. 
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}
	A morphism $A \to B$ is bounded if and only if it is continuous. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
	A Banach $K$-algebra, $A$, is a commutative, associative, unital $K$-algebra with a submultiplicative norm that is a Banach $K$-algebra.
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be a $K$-algebra. 
	Two norms $\|\cdot \|_1, \|\cdot \|_2$on $A$ are called equivalent if and only if they induce the same topology. 

	This means that there are non-zero constants $C, C'$ such that for every $ a\in A$ we have $C\|a\|_1 \le \|a\|_2 \le C'\|a\|_1$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be an $k$ banach algebra nd $I$ be a closed\todo{do we need closed here} ideal in $A$. 
	Then we define the \emph{residue norm} on $A / I$ as 
	\begin{align*}
		\|\cdot \|_\text{res} : A / I &\longrightarrow \R \\
		a + I &\longmapsto \inf_{x \in a + I} \|x\|
	.\end{align*}
\end{definition}

To describe the cateogory of $K$-banach algebras we still need morphisms.
\begin{definition}
	Let $A, B$ be $K$-banach algbras. 
	A $K$-algebra morphism $\phi: A \to B$ is \emph{admissible} if $\phi$ is bounded (continuous) if induced map $A / \ker \phi \to \im \phi$ is a homeomorphism, where $A / \ker \phi$ is equipped with the residue norm and $\im \phi$ with subspace norm of $B$. 
\end{definition}


To an affinoid algebra we can also associate a Berkovich space, which will be sligtly differently defined than the berkovich norm for any space, because we need to introduce the concept of a bounded norm.

\begin{definition}
	Let $(A, \|\cdot \|)$ be a Banach $K$-algebra. Another norm $\|\cdot \|'$ on $A$ \emph{bounded}  if there is some constant $C$ such that  $\|a\|' \le C \|a\|$ for all $a \in A$. 
\end{definition}

\begin{remark}
	If $\|\cdot \|'$ is multiplicative then we may assume the constant $C$ to be $1$. 
	I.e.\ a multiplicative norm $\|\cdot \|'$ is bounded if and only if  for all $a \in A: \|a\|' \le \|a\|$. 
\end{remark}
\begin{proof}
	For any $n \in \N, a \in A$ we find $\|a^{n}\|' \le C \|a^{n}\| \le C \|a\|^{n}$. 
	Taking the $n$ 'th root yields \[
		\|a\|' \le \sqrt[n]{C} \|a\|
	.\] 
	Taking the limit $n \to \infty$ yields the desired inequality. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\label{def:spectrum_banach_algebra}
	Let $(A, \|\cdot \|)$ be a Banach $K$-algebra. 
	The Berchovich spectrum (as a topological space) is \[
		\mathcal{M} (A) = \{x: A \to\R^{+} \st x \text{ is a bounded multiplicative seminorm}\} 
	\] 
	equipped with the coarsest topology that makes all maps $\mathcal{M} (A) \to \R: x \mapsto |a|_x$ continuous. 
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}\label{prop:norm_spectrum_extends_base_field}
	Every norm in $\mathcal{M} (A)$ extends the norm on $K$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $(A, \|\cdot \|)$ is a Banach $K$-algebra. 
	Let $x \in \mathcal{M} (A)$ be a norm. 
	Then for any $\lambda \in K, \lambda \ne 0$ we have $|\lambda|_x \le  \|\lambda\cdot 1\| = |\lambda| \cdot \|1\| = |\lambda|$. 
	Similarly $|\lambda|_x^{-1} = |\lambda^{-1}|_x  \le |\lambda^{-1}| = |\lambda|^{-1}$. 
	From this it follows that $|\lambda_x| = |\lambda|$
\end{proof}


\begin{proposition}
	$\mathcal{M} (A)$ is non-empty. 
	In particularly for every maximal ideal $\mathfrak{m}  \subset  A$ there is a norm $x \in \mathcal{M} (A)$ such that $\ker x = \mathfrak{m} $.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Let $\mathfrak{m}$ be a maximal ideal of $A$. 
	Then $\frac{A}{\mathfrak{m} }$ with at least one submultiplicative norm induced by the norm on  $A$. 
	So the set of submultiplicative norms on  $A/\mathfrak{m} $ is non-empty and may be partially ordered by $|\cdot |_1 \le |\cdot |_2$ if $|a|_1 \le |a|_2$ for all $a \in A / \mathfrak{m} $. 

	So by Zorn's lemma there is a minimal such norm $|\cdot |_\text{min} $ on $\mathcal{A}  / \mathfrak{m} $. 
	I claim that this norm is multiplicative. 
	First we will show that $|\cdot |_\text{min} $ is power multiplicative. 
	Define $\rho(a) = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sqrt[n]{|a^{n}|_\text{min} } $. Then $\rho$ is powermultiplicative and $\rho \le |\cdot |_\text{min} $. Hence $\rho = |\cdot |_\text{min} $. 
	\todo{ask johannes whether this is correct}

	Now we can easily show that $|\cdot |_\text{min} $ is multiplicative. 
	Let $f, g \ne 0$ be elements in $A / \mathfrak{m} $, then \[
		|fg| \le |f|\cdot |g| \le (|f^{-1}| \cdot |g^{-1}|)^{-1} \le |(fg)^{-1}|^{-1} = |fg|. 
	\]
	We can now pull back $|\cdot |_\text{min} $ to $A$ which yields the desired norm. 
\end{proof}

\begin{corollary}\label{cor:non_vanish_invertible}
	An element $a \in A$ is invertible if and only if $|a|_x > 0, \forall x \in \mathcal{M} (A)$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	\ltr
	Suppose $a $ is invertible. Then for any  $x \in \mathcal{M} (A)$ we have that $1 = |1|_x = |a^{-1}a|_x = |a|_x |a^{-1}|_x$, from which it is clear tha $|a|_x \ne 0$. 

	\rtl Suppose $a$ is not invertible. Then there is some maximal $\mathfrak{m}  $ ideal containing $a$. 
	By the previous proposition there is some $x \in \mathcal{M} (A)$ such that $\ker x = \mathfrak{m} $ and thus $|a|_x = 0$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
	The topology on $\mathcal{M} (A)$ is haussdorf and compact. \todo{check the conditions and give a proof}
\end{proposition}
\subsection{Affinoid algebras} \label{sec:affinoid_algebras}
We need restrict the category of banach algebras to those that are ``finitely generated'' in some appropriate sense. 

\begin{definition}
	[2.1.2, \cite{conrad2008several}]
	Let $A$ non-archimedean ring and $r_1, \ldots, r_n$ some positive real numbers. We define \[
		A \left<r_1^{-1}t_1, \ldots, r_{n}^{-1} t_n \right> = \left\{\sum_{\nu \in \N^{n}}^{} a_\nu t^{\nu} \in A[[t_1,\ldots, t_n]]\st a_\nu r^{\nu} \to 0, \text{ as } \nu \to \infty\right\} 
	.\] 
\end{definition}
This can be thought of as the completing of the polynomial ring $A[x_1, \ldots, x_n]$ with the norm defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:norm_tate}
	\left\| \sum_{\nu \in \N^{n}} a_\nu y^{\nu}\right\| = \max_{\nu \in \N^{n}} \|a_\nu r^{\nu}\|
\end{equation}
This gives a similarly defined norm on $A\left<y_1, \ldots, y_n \right>$, but there are many other interesting norms on $A \left<y_1, \ldots, y_n \right>$, as we will discover. 

\begin{definition}
	A \emph{Tate algebra} in $n$ variables is the ring \[
		T_n(K) = K\left<T_1, \ldots, T_n \right>
	,\]
	equipped with the norm as in \eqref{eq:norm_tate}.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
	A affinoid algebra is a $K$-algebra $A$ with such that there is an admissible surjective morphism $f: K\left<\underline r ^{-1} \underline T \right> \to A$ for some $\underline r = (r_1, \ldots, r_n)$. 

	An affinoid algebra is said to be \emph{strict} if it admists such morphism with $r_i  \in |K^{\times }|$ for all $i$. 
	For any group $H$, with $|K^{\times }| \subset  H \subset \R^{ +}$ the algebra $A$ is said to be \emph{$H$-strict} if and it admists such morphism with $r_i \in H$ for $i$. 
\end{definition}
This means that $A$ can be written as $K\left<T_1, \ldots, T_n \right> / I$ where $I$ is some closed ideal.
This does not mean that $A$ necessarily comes equipped with the residue norm, but this doesn't matter as the open mapping theorem shows that the norm on $A$ must be equivalent to residue norm.

\subsection{Affinoid domains} \label{sec:affinoid_domains}

In order to turn $\mathcal{M} (A)$ into a ringed space and define a structure sheaf we need an analogue of affine opens on which we know what the sections of the structure sheaf should be. 
We will describe these domains by a universal property that also characterises 

\begin{definition}
	Let $\mathcal{M} (A)$ be the Berkovich spectrum of a affinoid algebra. 
	An ($H$-strict) affinoid domain is a (closed)\todo{Do we need to require closed here?} subset $V \subset  \mathcal{M} (A)$ together with bounded morphism of ($H$-strict) affinoid domain algebras $f:A \to A_V$ \emph{representing} $V$.
	This means that 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item the image of the induced map $\phi:\mathcal{M} (A_V) \to \mathcal{M} (A)$ is $V$ 
		\item every bounded $K$-banach algebra morphism $A \to B$ such that the image of $\mathcal{M} (B)$ in $\mathcal{M} (A)$ is contined in $V$ factors through $A_V$ \[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		A \ar{rr}{\phi} \ar{dr}& & A_V \ar[dashed]{dl} \\
				& B
	\end{tikzcd}
	.\] 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}


It is not easy to describe the affinoid domains for a given $\mathcal{M} (A)$ as explicitly as in the case of $\spec$ for rings. 
But there are a couple explicit ones that will be "enough" to develep the theory. 
\begin{definition}[multiple definitions in \cite{conrad2008several}]
	\todo{change this to temkins definition}
	Let $A$ be an $K$-affinoid algebra. 
		There are \emph{weierstrass domains, laurent domains} and \emph{rational domains}. 
	\begin{description}
		\item[Weierstrass domain] Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ be in $A$ and $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in H$. 
			\[
				A\left<r_1^{-1}a_1, \ldots, r_n^{-1}a_n \right> := \frac{a\left<r^{-1}x_1, \ldots, r^{-1}_nx_n \right>}{(x_1-a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n)}
			.\] 
			Unlike for polynomial rings, this is not an evaulation map. You should think of this as forcing the $a_i$'s to become powerbounded. 
		\item [Laurent domains]
			Let $a_1, \ldots, a_n, b_1, \ldots, b_m \in A$ and $r_1,\ldots, r_n, s_1, \ldots, s_m \in H$then \[
				A\left<r_1^{-1}a_1, \ldots, r_n^{-1}a_n, s^{-1}_1b_1^{-1}, \ldots, s^{-1}_mb_m^{-1} \right> := \frac{A\left<r^{-1}_1x_1, \ldots, r^{-1}_nx_n,s^{-1}_1y_1, \ldots,s_m^{-1} y_m  \right>}{(x_1 - a_1, \ldots, x_n - a_n, b_1 y_1 - 1, \ldots, b_m y_m - 1)}
			.\] 
		\item[Rational domain] With $a_1, \ldots, a_n, a' \in A$ with no common zeros, i.e. there is no $\mathfrak{m} $ that contains both of these elements and $r_1, \ldots, r_n \in H$. 
			\[
				A \left<r_1^{-1}\frac{a_1}{a'}, \ldots, r_n^{-1}\frac{a_n}{a'} \right> := \frac{A\left<r_1^{-1}x_1, \ldots, r_n^{-1}x_n \right>}{(a' x_1 - a_1, \ldots, a' x_n - a_n)}
			.\] 
			This is essentially the affinoid version of localisation.
			But it does more than just make $a'$ invertible. 
			It also makes $\frac{a_i}{ a'}$ act like it is power bounded in some sense. 
		\item 
	\end{description}

\end{definition}

It is clear that Weierstrass domains and Laurent domains are specific types of rational domains. 
\begin{proposition}
	Let $A$ be a an ($H$-strict) affinoid ring and $a_1, \ldots, a_n, a' \in A$ without common zero.
	Then the map $A \to A\left<\frac{a_1}{a'}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{a'} \right>$ represents the domain \[
		\mathcal{M} \left(A \left<r^{-1}_1\frac{a_1}{a'}, \ldots, r^{-1}_n\frac{a_n}{a'}\right> \right) = \{x \in \mathcal{M} (A) \st |a_i|_x \le r_i|a'|, \forall i \in 1, \ldots, n\} 
	.\] 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	Lets denote the domain as above by $V$. 
	Let $f:A \to B$ be an admissible morphism such that for the reduced morphism $\phi: \mathcal{M} (B) \to \mathcal{M} (A)$ the image $\im \phi \subset  V$.
	Note that because there are no common zeroes, this means that $|a'|_x \ne 0$ for all $x \in V$. 
	So $|f(a')|_{y} \ne 0$ for all $y \in \mathcal{M} (B)$. 
	Hence $f(a')$ is invertible in $B$ by \cref{cor:non_vanish_invertible}. 

	Recall that \[
	A\left<r^{-1}_1\frac{a_1}{a'}, \ldots, r_n^{-1}\frac{a_n}{a'} \right> = \frac{A\left<r_1^{-1}x_1, \ldots, r_n^{-1}x_n \right>}{(a' x_1 - a_1, \ldots, a' x_n - a_n)}
	.\] 

	So to define a map to $B$ that extends the map $f$ from $A$ we need to define the images $x_i$. 
	We need to be able to quotient this map from by the ideal generated by $a'x_i - a_i$. 
	So its clear that the only way to define this map is like:
	\begin{align*}
		g: A\left<x_1, \ldots, x_n \right> &\longrightarrow B \\
		x_i &\longmapsto f(a_i) / f(a')
	.\end{align*}
	This is well defined as $f(a')$ is invertible and $|f(a_i) / f(a')|_x = |a_i|_{\phi(x)} / |a'|_{\phi(x)} \le 1$ as $\phi(x) \in V$. 
	So $f(a_i) / f(a')$ is powerbound. \todo{write a lemma or something that shows this is correct reasoning. }
	We can easily check that $a'x_i - a_i \in \ker g$ for every $i$. Hence this defines a map $A \left<\frac{a_1}{a'}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{a'} \right>$ as desired. 
\end{proof}

While we don't know what general affinoid domains look like, the following theorem shows that we can get by with just rational domains. 
\begin{proposition}
	[Gerritzen-Grauert Theorem]
	A $H$-affinoid domain $V \subset  \mathcal{M} (A)$ is a finite union of $H$-strict rational domains in $X$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
	There are many very techincal proofs that depend on the theory of rigid geometry (a predecessor of Berkovich geometry).
	The easiest proof and one that is enterely in the language of berkovich geometry is one by Temkin \cite{temkinNewProofGerritzenGrauert2005}.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Interlude: $G$-topologies} \label{sec:interlude_g_topologies}

In the next section we will turn $\mathcal{M} (A)$ into a ringed space. 
But we will not do this with the cannonical topology as defined in \cref{def:spectrum_banach_algebra}. 
In fact the topology that we will use is not a ordinary topology at all. 
It will be a $G$-topology, which is a notion somewhere in between an ordinary topology and a Grothendieck site. 
For a $G$ topology on $X$
the category of opens will still be a collection of subsets of $X$ with inclusion maps, closed under \todo{finite or infinite} union and (finite) intersection. 
But the set of covers may be restricted. 
In this section we will follow \cite[][sec. 9.1.]{siegfriedboschNonArchimedeanAnalysisSystematic1984}

\begin{definition}
	[$G$-topology]
	Let $X$ be a set. 
	A $G$-topology $\mathcal{T} $ on $X $ consists of 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  a collection $S$ of sets in $X$ we are called \emph{admissible opens},
		\item for every admissible open $U \in S$ a set $\cov U$ consisting set theoretic covers of $U$ by admissible opens,
	\end{itemize}
	which are subject to the following conditions:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $S$ is closed under finite intersections
		\item For any admissible open $U$ is $\{U\}$ and admissible cover of $U$.
		\item If $\{U_i\}_{i \in I} \in \Cov U $ and for each $U_i$ there is a an cover $\{V_{i, j}\}_{j \in J_i} \in \cov U_i$ then $\{V_{ij}\} _{i \in I, j \in J}$ is a an admissible cover of $U$
		\item If  $U, V$ are admissible opens with $V \subset  U$ and given an admissible cover $\{U_i\}_{i \in I} $ of $U$, then $\{V \cap U_i\} _{i \in I}$ is an admissible cover of $V$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
\begin{example}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Any topological space is a $G$-topological space by letting $S$ be the set of opens and the for any open  $U$ define $\cov U$ to be all the set theoretic covers. 
		\item A less obvious $G$-topological way is the following. 
			Let $X$ be any topological space. 
			Let $S$ be the set of closed sets in $X$ and let the admissible covers be the finite set theoretic covers. 
	\end{itemize}
\end{example}
This last example is somewhat related to the topology that we will eventually define on $\mathcal{M} (A)$. 
Most definitions for topological spaces carry straight over to $G$-topological spaces, for example: 
\begin{definition}
	These definitions should not be suprising, but take note how reduced structure of $G$-topologies forces us to be slightly more precise.  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  Let $X, Y$ be $G$-topological spaces. 
			A function $f: X \to Y$ is called \emph{continuous} if every inverse of an admissible open in $X$ is an admissible open, and every inverese of an admissible cover $\{U_i\} $ of $U$ gives an admissible cover $\{f^{-1}(U_i)\} $ of $f^{-1}(U)$. 
		\item A $G$-topological space $X$ is \emph{compact} if $X$ itself is an admissibl open and every admissible cover of $X$ can be reduced to a finite admissible cover. 
		\item A $G$-topological space $X$ is \emph{disconnected} if there is a an admissible cover $\{U_i\} _{i \in I}$ of $X$ such that there we can split the index set $I = I_1 \sqcup I_2$  such that \[
				\left(\bigcup_{i \in  I_1} U_i\right)\cap \left( \bigcup_{i \in I_2}  \right)  = \emptyset, \text{ and } \bigcup_{i \in I_1} U_i, \bigcup_{i \in I_2} U_i \text{ are nonempty}
		.\] 
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}

Sometimes we wish to have slightly more structure on our $G$ topologies.
\begin{definition}
	Let $\mathcal{T} $ be a $G$-topology a set $X$. 
	We define the properties $(G_0), (G_1)$ and $(G_2)$ as follows 
	\begin{enumerate}
	\item[($G_1$)] $\emptyset$ and $X$ are admissible open subsets in $X$.  
	\item [($G_1$)] Let  $U$ be an admissible open and $V \subset  U$ any subset. 
		Suppose that there is a cover $\{U_i\} _{i \in I} $ of $U$ such that $V \cap U_i$ is admissible for any $i \in I$. 
		Then $V$ is an admissible open. 
	\item[($G_2$)]
		Let $U$ be an admissible open and  $\{U_{i}\}_{i \in I}$ be a set theoretic covering such that each $U_i$ is an admissible open. 
		Suppose that $\{U_i\}  _{i \in I}$ has an admissible refinement. Then $\{U_{i}\} _{i \in I}$ is an admissible cover of $U$. 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}

Property $(G_0)$ is just something we are used to from ordinary topological spaces. 
Property $(G_1)$ states that whether a set is admissible may be checked locally and property $(G_2)$ states that whether a cover is admissible may be checked locally. 
These last two are crucial to impose when we eventually want to glue  $G$-topological spaces, as they assure that the topology is defined locally. 

$G$-topologies contain just the right amount of information to define a sheaf theory. 
\begin{definition}
	Let $(X, \mathcal{T} )$ be a $G$-topological space.
	A \emph{presheaf on $X$} with values in a category $\mathcal{C} $ is a functor $\mathcal{F} :S^{\text{op}} \to \mathcal{S} $. 

	A presheaf $\mathcal{F} $ is called a \emph{sheaf} if for any admissible open  $U$ and cover $\{U_i\}_i $ of $U$ the sequence \[
	\begin{tikzcd}
		\mathcal{F} (U) \rar & \prod_{i \in I} \mathcal{F} (U_i) \rar[shift left]\rar[shift right] & \prod_{i, j \in I} \mathcal{F} (U_{i} \cap U_j)
	\end{tikzcd}
	\] 
	is exact. 
	\todo{what assumptions do we exactly need on the category $\mathcal{C}$?}
\end{definition}
So a $G$-topological space defines a \emph{topos}. 
One may wonder if we can refine a $G$-topological space so it satisfied extra desired properties while preserving the associated topos. 

Given a certain subcategory $\mathfrak{S} $ of $G$-topological spaces, there is a construction that refines all topologies on all objects in $\mathfrak{S} $ into ones that satisfy $(G_1)$ and $(G_2)$, while preserving all the topoi. 

\begin{definition}
	Let $(X, \mathcal{T}) \in \mathfrak{S} $ be an object and $\{U_i\} _{i \in I}$ any set theoretic covering of any subset $U \subset  X$. 
	We say  $\{U_i\} _{i \in I}$ is \emph{compatible} if for any morphism in $\mathcal{S}, \phi: Y \to X $ and for any admissible open $V \subset  Y$ with $\phi(V) \subset  U$ the covering $\{\phi^{-1}(U_i) \cap V\} _{i \in I}$ of $V$ can be refined by an admissible cover in $Y$. 
\end{definition}

\todo{refer to the right results}

\begin{definition}
	For any object $(X, \mathcal{T}) \in \mathfrak{S} $ we may define a new $G$-topology $\mathcal{T} '$ where the admissible opens are all sets that admit a compatible cover and the covers are all compatible covers. 
\end{definition}

\todo{Do I need this section?}




\subsection{The structure sheaf on $\mathcal{M} (A)$} \label{sec:the_structure_sheaf_on_ma}

First we need to define a $G$-topology. In this section it doesn't really matter whether we work with strict or $H$-strict or non-strict affinoid algebras. So we will work in the most general case and let all algebras be non-strict unless specified otherwise.  

\begin{definition}
	Let $A$ be a affinoid algebra. 
	The \emph{weak $G$-topology} on $\mathcal{M} (A)$ is the topology where the admissible opens are the affinoid domains and the covers are finite set theoretic covers of affinoid domains. 
\end{definition}

We can define a presheaf $\mathcal{O}_X$ on $X =\mathcal{M} (A)$ with the weak  $G$-topology by defining $\mathcal{O}_X(V) = \mathcal{A} _V$ for any affinoid domain $V$ represented by $\mathcal{A}_V$.
The restiction maps are given by the defining property of affinoid domains.


\subsection{admissible opens, covers and $g$-topology} \label{sec:admissible_opens,_covers_and_g-topology}

\begin{definition}
	[2.2.6, \cite{conrad2008several}]
	let $a$ be a  $k$ affinoid algebra. 
	a subset $u$ of $\maxspec(a)$ is an \emph{admissible open} if is has a cover $\{u_i\} $ of affinoid subdomains $u_i$ satisfying the following property: 
	for any map of $k$-affinoid algebras $\phi: a \to b$ such that the induced map $f: m(b) \to m(a)$ lands in $u$, the pullback of the cover $\{f^{-1}(u_i)\} $ has a finite subcovering. 


	a covering $v = \bigcup_{i \in  i} v_i$ is an \emph{admissible cover} if for any any map $\phi:a \to b$  of $k$-affinoid algebras that the image of  $f: m(b) \to m(a)$ lies in $v$, the pullback cover $\{f^{-1}(v_i)\} $ has a refinement by a covering consisting of finitely many affinoid subdomains.  
\end{definition}
\begin{proof}
	\todo{look at this proof}
\end{proof}

we need this to define the notion of a $g$-topology, which is a grothendieck topology on the set $\maxspec(a)$. 
i'm pretty sure later we will scrap $\maxspec$ in favour of the berkovich space.



\todo{Look at temkins notes for Gerritzen-Grauert, paper in mathematische analen.}
