Let $R$ be any ring. On rings like $\Z$ and $\Q$ we have ways of measuring how low \emph{large} each element is. We even have such functions on polynomials using the degree map. Depending on which properties these functions satisfy such ``measuring'' functions are called absolute values, norms or valuations. 
\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a ring. A \emph{absolute value on $R$} is a function $|\cdot |: R \to \R^{+}$ satisfying for all $a, b \in R$
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $|a| = 0 \iff a = 0$ 
		\item $|a \cdot b| = |a| \cdot |b|$ 
		\item $|a + b| \le |a| + |b|$
	\end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
Note that $R$ is not the zero ring, then $|1| = 1$ because $|1|^2 = |1| $ and $|1|\ne 0 $. 
\begin{example}
	The usual definition of absolute value on $\Z, \Q, \R$ is an absolute value. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	On any ring we can define the trivial absolute value as \[
	 |a| = \begin{cases}
		 1 & a \ne 0 \\
		 0 & a = 0
	 \end{cases}
	.\] 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
	A weirder absolute value on $\Z$ is the \emph{$p$-adic absolute value}, where $p$ is a prime. 
	Its defined as $|a|_p = p^{-n}$ where $n$ is the largest integers such that $p^{n} \divides a$, if $a \ne 0$ and $|0|_p = 0$. 


	This $p$-adic absolute value can be extended to an absolute value on $\Q$ by defining $|a / b|_p = \frac{|a|_p}{|b|_p}$. Let $\frac{a}{b}$ be any fraction. 
	I like to think about this in the following way. 
	Factor out the largest powers of $p$ out of $a$ and $b$ and write $a = p^{n} a', b = p^{m} b'$. Then $\frac{a}{ b} = p^{n - m} \frac{a'}{ b'}$ and $|a / b|_p = p^{m - n}$. 
	So the $p$-adic absolute values only cares about what powers of $p$ occur and doesn't care about numbers coprime to $p $.
\end{example}
As we will see in \cref{sec:berkovich_spectrum_of_Z}, we have esssentially listed all absolute values on $\Z$ and $\Q$ as examples above.  

Absolute values are a special case of (semi)norms
\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be any ring. A \emph{seminorm on $R$} is a function $\|\cdot \|: R \to \R^{+}$ satisfying for all $a, b \in R$ 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item $\|0\| = 0, \|1\| = 1$
		\item $\|a \cdot b\| \le \|a \| \cdot \|b\|$ 
		\item $\|a + b\| \le \|a + b\|$ 
	\end{enumerate}
	Condition $2$ is called the submultiplicativity of $|\cdot |$ and condition 3 is called the triangle inequality. Both of these can be made stronger. 

	A seminorm is called \emph{multiplicative} if it also satisfies a stronger vrersion of 2. 
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item [4.]  $\|a \cdot  b\| = \|a \| \cdot \|b\|$
	\end{enumerate}
	A seminorm that is only satisfies $2$ is sometimes called a \emph{submultiplicative seminorm} if we need to stress that is doesn't have to multiplicative. 
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
	The \emph{kernel} of a seminorm $\|\cdot \|: R \to \R^{+}$ is defined as \[
		\ker(\|\cdot \|) = \{a \in \R \st \|a\| = 0\} 
	.\] 
\end{definition}
\begin{remark}\label{rem:ker_norm_ideal}
	Let $\|\cdot \|$ be a norm on $R$. Then $\ker \|\cdot \|$ is an ideal of $R$. If $\|\cdot \|$ is multiplicative then $\ker \|\cdot \|$ is even a prime ideal!
	\todo{should I write a proof for this?}
\end{remark}

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a ring and $\|\cdot \|$ are seminorm. 
	Then $\|\cdot \|$ is called a \emph{norm} if $\ker \|\cdot \| = 0$, i.e.\ $\|a\| = 0 \iff a = 0$. 
\end{definition}

So an absolute value is a multiplicative norm. 

\begin{lemma}
	Any seminorm $\|\cdot \|$ on a field $F$ is a norm, i.e.\ has trivial kernel. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
	We have that $\|1\| = 1$. So $1 \not\in \ker \|\cdot \|$ and thus $\ker \|\cdot \|$ is an ideal of $F$ different from $F$. 
	As $F$ is a field this means that $\ker \|\cdot \| = (0)$. So $\|\cdot \|$ is norm. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	A (semi)norm $\|\cdot \|$ on $R$ is called \emph{non-archimedean} if it satisies the following stronger version of the triangle inequality, \[
	\forall a, b \in \R: \|a + b\| \le \max \{\|a\|, \|b\|\} 
	.\] 

	Confusingly a \emph{Archimedean (semi)norm} is a norm that is not non-archimedean.
\end{definition}

\begin{exercise}[\cite{nicaiseNONARCHIMEDEANGEOMETRY}]
	Let $k$ be a field.
	Show that a absolute value  $|\cdot |$ on $k$ is non-Archemedean if and only if the image of $\Z$ in $k$ is bounded. 
\end{exercise}
\begin{proof}
	Suppose $|\cdot |$ is non-archimedean. Then for any positive integers $n$ we have \[
	|n| = \left|\sum_{i = 1}^{n} 1 \right| \le \max \{1, 1, \ldots, 1\}  = 1
	.\] 
	And for negative integers we have $|n| = |-n| \le 1$. So $\|\cdot \|$ is bounded on the image of $\Z$ by $1$. 


	Suppose that $|\cdot |$ is bounded on the image of $\Z$ by $c$. 
	Let $x, y \in k$. Then \[
		|(x + y)^{n}| = \left| \sum_{i = 0}^{n} \binom{i}{n} x ^{i} y ^{n-i}\right| \le n\cdot c \max(x, y)^{n}
	.\] 
	So \[
		|x + y| \le \sqrt[n]{c\cdot n}  \max(x, y)
	.\] 
	Taking $n \to \infty$ yields the non-archimedean triangle inequality. 
\end{proof}

\begin{remark}
	Suppose $R$ is non-archimedean and we have $a, b \in R$ such that $\|a\| \ne \|b\|$ then the triangle inequality is an equality \[
	\|a + b\| = \max \{\|a\|, \|b\|\} 
	.\] 
	So in some sense equality is the generic case. 
\end{remark}
It may sound like a really strong property to have, and that not many norms will be non-archimedean. 
But as you will see in this thesis, most norms that pop up are non-archimedean. 
In fact that $p$-adic norms are non-archimedian.

\subsection{Non-Archimedean rings and fields} \label{sec:non-archimedean_rings_and_fields}


\begin{theorem}\label{thm:norm_finite_field_ext}
	If $L$ is a finite \todo{should this be algebraic?} field extension of an non-archimedean field $K$, then there is a unique extension of the norm of $K$ to $L$ and this extension is also non-archimedean.
	\todo{find reference, this is not even true. $K$ needs to be complete }
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
	If $K$ is a complete non-archimedean field then the norm of  $K$ extends uniquely to its algebraic closure $\overline{K}$.
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
	Recall that \[
	\overline{K} = \varprojlim_{L \supset K} L
	.\] 
	where $L$ ranges over all algebraic extensions of $K$. 
	As all these algebraic extensions have unique norms extending  the norm on $K$ and for $L_1 \supset L_2 \supset K$ the norm on  $L_1$ must restrict to norm on $L_2$ by uniqueness, it is clear that the norm functions $L \to \R^{+}$ glue to a map $\|\cdot \|: \overline{K} \to \R^{+}$. 

	It is easy to verify that this is a norm on $\overline{K}$ extending the norm on $K$. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}
	Let $R$ be a non-archimedean ring. Then we write 
	\begin{align*}
		R^{0} &= \{a \in k \st |k| \le 1\}  \\
		R^{00} &=  \{a \in k \st |k| < 1\}  \\
		\tilde R &= R^{0} / R^{00}
	.\end{align*}
\end{definition}
If $k$ is a field then $k^{0}$ is a valuation ring and $ k^{00}$ is its maximal ideal. 

\subsection{Ultrametric spaces} \label{sec:ultrametric_spaces}

\begin{definition}
	A \emph{ultrametric space} is a topological spaces $(X, d)$ where the metric satisfies the non-archimedean triangle inequality. 
	\[
		d(x, y) \le \max \{d(x, z) ,d(z, y)\}, \quad \forall x, y ,z \in X
	.\] 
\end{definition}
\begin{exercise}
	If $d(x,z) \ne d(z,y)$ the inequality is an equality. 
\end{exercise}
\begin{corollary}
	Any point of a ball (open or closed) is a center for that ball. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
	If two balls have non-empty intersection that one must be included in the other. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{corollary}
	The topology of $X$ is totally disconneced. 
\end{corollary}

Non-archimedean fields are ultrametric spaces with the metric $d(x, y) = |x - y|$.
